\chapter{Superimposition} \label{chapter:superimposition}
The superimposition part of a concern is where you can make a selection of program elements, such as classes, and then superimpose certain entities, such as filter modules and annotations, on this selection.

The superimpositions parts are executed during the initialization of the application, this is necessary because the bindings need to be known before the execution starts.

With the changes in the filter module syntax, the superimposition syntax needs some minor adjustments as well.
The superimposition and its fields are all quite young, and moreover it is possible for all fields to point to the original proposal, were the field is proposed.

The superimposition part with the original selector and filter module binding are introduced by~\cite{salinas:ms01}. 
The new improved selector and annotation binding are introduced by~\cite{Havinga2005}.

\section{Syntax}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = {Superimposition syntax}, label = lst::ARM:si:syntax, style = listing, language = ebnf, float = tpb]
Superimposition = '{' [Conditionals] [Selectors] [FilterModuleBindings] [AnnotationBindings] [Constraints] '}';
\end{lstlisting}
The syntax, as demonstrated in \autoref{lst::ARM:si:syntax}, shows the syntax of the superimposition part. 
The result is the skeleton as demonstrated in \autoref{lst::ARM:si:example1}.

\section{Semantics}
The superimposition itself is a holder of blocks for selecting elements and defining bindings. 
It is executed during initialization of an application.

\section{Examples}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The superimposition skeleton}, label = lst::ARM:si:example1,
style=listing, language =ComposeStar, float = tpb]
superimposition{
	conditions
	  ...
  selectors
    ...
  filtermodules
    ...
  annotations
    ...
  constraints
    ...
}
\end{lstlisting}
A superimposition can have five blocks and the ordering of these blocks are fixed, the skeleton is demonstrated in \autoref{lst::ARM:si:example1}. 
There is also only zero or one instance of a block. 
The selectors makes a selection of language elements, which can be used in the filter module and annotation binding.
The conditions can be used for conditional binding of filter modules, and the constraints can be used to force an order of filter modules.

\section{Legality Rules}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item The ordering of the sub blocks is fixed and have the following ordering: conditions, selector, filter modules, annotations, and constraints;
\item Each sub block can only have one instance.
\end{itemize}

\para{The Ordering of the Selector Parts}
The ordering and number of occurrences of the sub blocks is fixed, this is characteristic for the whole \Compose* syntax.
The main reason to do so, is that this ensures that all the declarations of a certain type are all together placed on the same spot. 
Thus you can find all the selectors within one concern on the selectors block. 
It is possible to allow random and multiple placement of the superimposition and its sub blocks. 
However, the readability would drop because users do not longer know where to expect certain blocks. 
To keep everything organized is also the reason why there is only one superimposition block per concern.

\para{Selection of Program Elements}
Currently the selector is used to select only classes. 
However, with the adding the filter module parameters and some other upcoming research it will be possible to select much more then classes and probably you can also superimpose items to the extended selections. 
Therefore the term \emph{program elements} is used instead of classes.
