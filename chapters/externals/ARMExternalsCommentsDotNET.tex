\para{Arguments in the initialization expression}
The possibility to use arguments in the initialization expression is currently not supported
by Compose*.Net. This is because the grammar does not support it and it is not certain whether
the other parts can handle them. So for now you should try to work around it, it will be
checked whether it can be fixed as soon as the filter module parameters are being implemented.
