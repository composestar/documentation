\chapter{Filter Module} \label{chapter:filtermodule}
The filter module is a reusable entity that holds two sets of filters: the input filters and the output filters. These filters can use objects and conditions, which are also defined in the filter module. 
A filter module is superimposed on a class and the filter module can extend the signature and the behavior of the class on which it is superimposed.

\section*{Syntax}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = {Filter module syntax}, label = lst::ARM:fm:syntax,
style = listing, language = ebnf, float = tpb]
FilterModule ::= `filtermodule' FilterModuleName [FilterModuleParameters] `{'
                  [Internals] [Externals] [Conditions]
                  [InputFilters] [OutputFilters] `}';
\end{lstlisting}
A filter module has a unique identifier in a concern; the uniqueness is defined over the name and not the name
in combination with the parameters.
The  ordering of the blocks
of a filter module
is fixed, thus it is only possible to use them in the ordering as shown in the syntax of \autoref{lst::ARM:fm:syntax}. The filter module template is demonstrated in
the concern template in \autoref{lst::arm::fm:tmtemplate}.
All the blocks are optional, making it possible to write a completely empty filter module.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={Composestar},style=floatlisting, caption={Filter module template},label={lst::arm::fm:tmtemplate}, floatplacement=tbp]
filtermodule ( ... ) {
  internals
    ...
  externals
    ...
  conditions
    ...
  inputfilters
    ...
  outputfilters
    ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section*{Semantics}

\end{figure}
A filter module is an entity that holds filter sets which are composed together.
The objects and the conditions that are used in the filters are also declared in the filter module.
\autoref{fig::arm::fm:schema} demonstrates
how a filter module can be visualized in a schema.
The schema shows a filter module superimposed to an object, this object is called the ``inner'' object.
Any message that is sent to the object goes through the input filters and any message that is sent
goes through the output filters. Both filter sets can use internals, externals, and conditions.
These elements are declared in the internals, externals, and conditions blocks.

\section*{Examples}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Dynamic strategy filter module from Pacman },label=lst::ARM:fil:example1,style=listing,language=ComposeStar,float=[tpb]]
filtermodule dynamicstrategy{
  internals
    stalk_strategy : pacman.Strategies.StalkerStrategy;
    flee_strategy : pacman.Strategies.FleeStrategy;   
  conditions
    pacmanIsEvil : pacman.Pacman.isEvil();
  inputfilters
    stalker_filter : Dispatch = {!pacmanIsEvil => 
      [*.getNextMove] stalk_strategy.getNextMove};
    flee_filter : Dispatch = {[*.getNextMove] flee_strategy.getNextMove}
}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Enqueue filter module from Jukebox },label=lst::ARM:fil:example2,style=listing,language=ComposeStar,float=[tpb]]
filtermodule Enqueue{
  externals
    playlist: Jukebox.Playlist = Jukebox.Playlist.instance();
  inputfilters
    meta : Meta = { True => [*.play] playlist.enqueue}
}
\end{lstlisting}
A filter module can consist of parameters, internals, externals, conditions, input filters, and output filters.
The blocks in which these filter elements are declared are all optional, so the shortest filter module you can write is \lstinline!filtermodule fm {}!. \autoref{lst::ARM:fil:example1}
and \autoref{lst::ARM:fil:example2} show two example filter modules taken from the \Compose* example directory~\cite{Composestar}. What the separate filter module elements do can be found in their respective
chapters, the examples are given to get an idea of how to build up a filter module.
The ordering of the blocks is fixed, so for instance, it is not possible to place the conditions block before the internals block.

\section*{Legality Rules}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item The identifier of a filter module must be unique for the concern where it is declared in;
\item The blocks in a filter module must be in the following ordering: internals, externals, conditions, input filters, and output filters;
\item You can only have one declaration of the above mentioned blocks, for example there can be only one set of internals.
\end{itemize}
