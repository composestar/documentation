\para{Parenthesis and Arguments}
The current implementation does not allow the usage of arguments in the condition declaration.
As mentioned in~\cite{Doornenbal2006}
it is a possible addition to the language to add arguments in the condition declaration, because of the introduction of the filter module parameters.

\para{The Use of Conditions from the Inner Object}
One of the possibilities to declare a condition is to use a boolean method of the inner object. 
As mentioned earlier, this option is not used in the current set of examples. 
We can say that it is not widely used due to two limitations:
the methods must exist and you should know this when you write the selector. 
Filter modules are imposed on multiple classes and when a method of the inner class is used, then all the multiple classes must contain this method.

There are three ways to use a condition from an inner object without getting any problems with non-existing methods. 
The first is to write filter modules for just one class or its child classes. 
The second use for conditions from the inner object is if you select all the classes which implement a certain interface. 
In that scenario you know whether the boolean method is available if it is in the signature of the interface.
The third one is code conventions, if you use a code convention that classes with a certain annotation all have a method called \emph{foo}, then it is also possible to use the conditions from the inner object safely.

\para{Conditions bound to Static Methods}
It is currently not possible to bind conditions to static methods, this functionality has not be implemented.

\para{Language Independent Conditions}
The selector in the superimposition uses predicate queries to select certain attributes of an application. 
It uses a language independent model of language constructs and each language gets translated to this independent model~\cite{Havinga2005}. 
For instance it uses the term namespace, which gets translated to package for the Java language. 
In theory it is possible to write such language independent model on objects and its attributes, so that we can write language independent conditions with predicate queries. 
This would make it possible to write conditions that are reusable even for another platform.
