\chapter{Filter Matching Part}
The matching part of a filter is where the message is being matched. There are
two different types of matching: name and signature matching.

\section*{Syntax}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Filter matching part syntax},label=lst::ARM:mp:syntax,style = listing,language = ebnf,float=tpb]
FilterElement ::= [ConditionExpression ConditionOperator] MessagePattern
MessagePattern ::= Matching [SubstitutionPart]
                   | MatchPattern
                   | `{' Matching (`,' Matching)* `}' [SubstitutionPart] 
Matching ::= SignatureMatching | NameMatching
SignatureMatching ::= `<' MatchPattern `>'
NameMatching ::= `[' MatchPattern `]' | Quote MatchPattern Quote
MatchPattern ::= [Target `.'] Selector
\end{lstlisting}
The syntax of the matching part is shown in \autoref{lst::ARM:mp:syntax}. The basic form is
\lstinline|target.selector| surrounded by the tokens that mark the type of matching. It is possible
to leave out these tokens when only a single MatchPattern is used, in that situation signature matching is applied by default.
The target needs to be an internal, external, or the keyword \emph{inner}. The selector must be a method name.
To indicate whether you want to use name matching or signature matching you can use square brackets (\lstinline![]!) or double quotes (\lstinline!`` ''!) for name matching and angle brackets (\lstinline!< >!) for signature matching.

\section*{Semantics}
The name matching checks the target part of the match and the
selector part. The use of the keyword ``inner'' 
is, as you might expect, quite trivial for a name matching in an input filter.

Signature matching checks whether the selector of the message is in the signature of the given target. This means that it is only useful to fill in the target when a signature matching is used.
Filling in the selector in the signature matching has no use, because \lstinline|<foo.bar>| will
always hold or always fail.

Both the target and the selector can be a parameter, for the selector it is also possible to use a list of parameters.
With a list of parameters it means that one entry in the list must match.

When you have a dispatch filter ands the selector is not in the signature of the object on which is superimposed, then the selector is added to the
signature of this object. This mechanism is not used when a wild card is used on the selector spot,
because that would imply that the signature becomes every possible method. The mechanism also works on singnature matching, which makes it possible to add the signature of the internal or external to the object on which is superimposed.

\section*{Examples}
Three matching parts are demonstrated in \autoref{lst::ARM:ARMMP:example1} line 3. The first two
are of the \emph{name matching} type and the third is an example of \emph{signature matching}.
The matching \lstinline|[tar.sel]| first whether the target points to the same object as where ``tar'' refers to and
it will try to match whether the selector is ``sel''. The second one,
\lstinline|[*.sel]| ignores the target, because a wild card (``*'') is used and the selector is matched
with ``sel''. The last one, \lstinline|<tar.*>| checks whether the selector is in the signature of ``tar''.

The second filter d2 on line 4 demonstrates how you can do a name matching where the selector must match when the selector is not \lstinline!foo! and not \lstinline!bar!.
The matching works as follows, when a selector is one of the values of the list you get a match. Because of the \lstinline[language=Composestar]|~>| this match becomes a reject, thus making this
filter to reject when the selector is \lstinline!foo! or \lstinline!bar!.
Especially for this type on of constructions a matching list is introduced.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Some possible matching parts},label=lst::ARM:ARMMP:example1,
style=listing,language =ComposeStar,float=tpb]
filtermodule example{
  inputfilters
    d : Dispatch = {[tar.sel] *.*, [*.sel] *.*, <tar.*> *.*};
    d2 : Dispatch = {True ~> {[*.foo] , [*.bar]} inner.*}
\end{lstlisting}

It is also possible to use parameters as the target and the selector, for the target
only a single parameter can be used, while for the selector both a single parameter and a list of parameters can be used.

\section*{Legality rules}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item The used target must be a declared internal, external, the keyword ``inner'', or a parameter;
\item A selector can be a method, a single parameter, or a list of parameters.
\end{itemize}

\faq{
\para{FAQ}
\question{Why is it not possible to use class names as targets?}
\answer{The messages are sent from object to object, therefore the choice is made to use objects as targets instead
of class names. The used identifier in the filters refers to internals, externals, or is the inner object (the object where is superimposed on).
It is however possible to achieve filtering on class names with a meta filter.
}

\para{Hints}
Keep an eye on the \lstinline|[*.*]| because any declaration afterwards does not get reached at all. Another
important thing is that in order to make exceptions for a \lstinline|[*.*]| matching, you can place a filter before
that matching.
