%Whereas the \Compose* syntax has been analyzed before the ARM was written for it, the message API has not been reviewed for this analysis. Practically it would mean that the Wiki entry could have been copied-paste into the appendix with some added information form API. threfroe it might be better to keep the links untill this information is better formatted and is then placed into the appendix.

\chapter{Message API}
When a meta filter is used a method with the argument \lstinline|Reifiedmessage rd| is being called.
This Reifiedmessage object contains the information of where it is sent to and who sent it.
it also has some methods to let the message go to its target or to let the message go the the object that sent it.

The explanation of the of the API can be found own the \Compose* Wiki at \url{http://janus.cs.utwente.nl:8000/twiki/bin/view/Composer/ReifiedMessage}.
The full API can be found in \url{http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~composestar/messageapi/Composestar/Runtime/FLIRT/message/ReifiedMessage.html}, which is part of the message API \url{http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~composestar/messageapi/}.
